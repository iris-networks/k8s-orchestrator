# Kubernetes Sandbox Platform

A Kubernetes-based service that provides isolated, browser-accessible desktop environments for users, powering https://agent.tryiris.dev.

## Why This Was Built

This platform was built to:
- Provide isolated sandbox environments for security testing and training
- Enable users to access desktop environments through browsers without local software installation
- Create disposable, isolated Linux environments that automatically clean up after use
- Support educational and training scenarios requiring isolated workspaces
- Facilitate safe web browsing in containerized environments

## Similar Platforms

This project shares similar goals with other cloud development environment platforms:

- **[Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/)** - Open-source development environment manager that provides instant, secure, and standardized development environments
- **[E2B](https://e2b.dev/)** - Cloud playground for AI agents and apps, offering sandboxed cloud environments for AI development and testing

While these platforms focus primarily on development environments, this Kubernetes sandbox platform is specifically designed for security testing, training scenarios, and providing browser-accessible desktop environments with automatic cleanup.

## Exposed Ports

- **API Server**: 8080 (container), mapped to 80 (service)
- **Per Sandbox VNC**: Port 6901 via unique subdomain (e.g., user123-vnc.tryiris.dev)
- **Per Sandbox HTTP**: Port 3000 via unique subdomain (e.g., user123-api.tryiris.dev)

## Features

- **Container Management**: Create/delete user sandboxes using a customized image with Chromium browser
- **Persistent Storage**: Attach user-specific persistent volumes that survive container restarts
- **Dynamic Subdomains**: Provision unique subdomains per user via Traefik
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Sandboxes are automatically removed after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **REST API**: Simple endpoints for container lifecycle management

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with Traefik ingress controller
- Docker
- Go 1.21+
- `kubectl` configured with appropriate permissions

### Creating a Sandbox

```bash
# Create a sandbox for user "user123"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/sandbox/user123

# The response will include a URL to access the sandbox via VNC web interface
```

### Managing Sandboxes

```bash
# List all sandboxes
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes

# Get status of a specific sandbox
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/sandbox/user123/status

# Delete a sandbox
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/sandbox/user123
```

## API Endpoints

### Sandbox Management
- `POST /v1/sandbox/{userId}` - Create user sandbox
- `DELETE /v1/sandbox/{userId}` - Delete user sandbox
- `GET /v1/sandbox/{userId}/status` - Get sandbox status
- `GET /v1/sandboxes` - List all sandboxes

### Administration
- `POST /v1/admin/cleanup?minutes={minutes}&auth={authToken}` - Cleanup sandboxes older than specified minutes
  - `minutes`: Age threshold in minutes
  - `auth`: Authentication token (required)
