# Docker Hub Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the k8sgo application to use Docker Hub images.

## Changes Made

1. **Docker Image Build and Push**
   - Built the Docker image and pushed it to Docker Hub as `shanurcsenitap/irisk8s:latest`
   - Created a `.dockerignore` file to optimize Docker builds
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated multi-platform builds on push to main and tags

2. **Multi-platform Support**
   - Added a script for building multi-platform Docker images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
   - Created new Makefile targets:
     - `docker-build`: Build the Docker image for the current platform
     - `docker-push`: Build and push the Docker image for the current platform
     - `docker-multiplatform`: Build and push multi-platform Docker images
     - `docker-multiplatform-tag`: Build and push multi-platform Docker images with a custom tag

3. **Helm Chart Updates**
   - Updated `values.yaml` to use the Docker Hub image with `Always` pull policy
   - Updated `values-aws.yaml` with Docker Hub image configuration
   - Updated `values-gcp.yaml` with Docker Hub image configuration
   - Updated `values-local.yaml` to use the Docker Hub image

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `helm-deployment.md` to reference the Docker Hub image
   - Updated `README.md` with:
     - Docker Hub image information including multi-platform support
     - Build and push commands for Docker images
     - Helm deployment recommendations
     - Links to detailed deployment documentation

5. **Docker Compose Update**
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use the Docker Hub image instead of building locally

## Using Multi-platform Docker Images

The Docker image `shanurcsenitap/irisk8s:latest` is now available as a multi-platform image that supports:
- linux/amd64 (Intel/AMD 64-bit)
- linux/arm64 (ARM 64-bit, e.g., Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton)

This allows the image to run natively on different processor architectures without emulation, improving performance.

## Building Custom Images

### Manual Builds

To build and push custom images manually:

```bash
# Single platform (current architecture)
make docker-build   # Build locally
make docker-push    # Build and push to Docker Hub

# Multi-platform (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
make docker-multiplatform            # Build and push with the 'latest' tag
make docker-multiplatform-tag TAG=v1.0.0  # Build and push with a custom tag
```

### Automated Builds with GitHub Actions

A GitHub Actions workflow has been added that automatically builds and pushes multi-platform Docker images:

- When pushing to the `main` branch: builds and pushes images tagged with `latest` and the branch name
- When pushing a tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`): builds and pushes images tagged with the version number
- When creating a pull request: builds the image but does not push it

To use the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: A Docker Hub access token with push permissions

2. Push to main or create a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

## Deployment

The recommended deployment method is using Helm with the pre-configured values files:

```bash
# Navigate to the helm chart directory
cd helm/k8s-orchestrator

# For local development
helm install k8s-orchestrator . -f values-local.yaml

# For AWS EKS
helm install k8s-orchestrator . -f values-aws.yaml

# For GCP GKE
helm install k8s-orchestrator . -f values-gcp.yaml
```
